Mendix applications run on the platform's cloud-native stateless runtime architecture that conforms to 12-factor principles with support for modern cloud platforms such as Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. As a result, Mendix apps benefit from auto-scaling, auto-provisioning, auto-healing, low infrastructure overhead, CI/CD, and cloud interoperability out of the box.
