## Where Do I Start with the Mendix Platform? {#start}

First, you will need to sign up on the platform by clicking **Start for free** on the [Mendix website](https://www.mendix.com/). Once signed up, you will be guided through a carefully planned onboarding experience, which only takes a few minutes. This will give you the grounding you need to get started building your first app in Mendix. From there, head over to the rich and diverse Mendix Community and Forum, or visit our Academy and get started on one of our many learning paths.

## How Can I Kick-Start My App Development Project? {#how}

The Mendix Platform comes with a series of starter apps, which provide all the scaffolding needed to get started building your first application. Starter apps combine with ready-made open-source components downloaded from the Mendix App Store, such as theme packs, UI templates, and logic to further accelerate the delivery of your first app. You can create company-specific starter apps as well as App Store components and store them in your company's Private App Store to accelerate development even more.
