## 1 What Is the Vision Behind Mendix? {#vision}

The fundamental belief at Mendix is that software should not be something just for IT. Every company needs to become a software company to survive in a software-driven world. The whole organization needs to be collaborating on the lifeblood of the business, which is software. The future of each company depends on it. Experimentation and innovation by people that know the business domain is key to survival.

The Mendix vision is to enable a whole range of people with different backgrounds to be successful in creating software that delivers actual business value. Mendix enables business domain experts through abstraction, automation, and intelligent assisted development. Mendix enables professional developers by giving them low-level control, extensibility using programming languages like Java and JavaScript, and a completely open meta-model as well as the APIs to interact with any part of the Mendix Platform, including the models.

This results in the three core principles of the Mendix Platform:

* **Speed** – In a world that is changing ever faster, IT backlogs are overflowing. To change that, software needs to be created much faster. App development must take place at the speed of the business.
* **Collaboration** – The talent gap for software development is only widening. Teaching more people to program will not solve this, as the gap is exponentially growing. So, we need to involve a much broader audience in software development. They key to faster and better software delivery is collaboration. The Mendix Platform brings the people with ideas together with the people with the technical aptitude to execute those ideas.
* **Control** – The Mendix Platform is focused on delivering enterprise software. Speed and collaboration are easy for simple applications, but for enterprise-grade software that needs to operate in a complex environment, it is more difficult. With Mendix, security, performance, scalability, and governance are built in. This means that the business can be enabled while IT stays in control.
